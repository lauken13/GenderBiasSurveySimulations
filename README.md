Code to replicate the simulation study from "He, she, they:  Using sex and gender in survey adjustment." 


Simulation study can be replicated using the Bias_Var_Comparison.R file in code, which we ran 500 times using the jobscript.sh. Figures were created and saved in Figures.Rmd (main paper) and Figures_Appendix.Rmd (appendices). 

Code (data not available due to privacy) for the in practice section is also available in three files. One to prep the data, and two to implement each method.
